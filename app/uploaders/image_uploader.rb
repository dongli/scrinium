  storage :file

  # Override the directory where uploaded files will be stored.
  # This is a sensible default for uploaders that are meant to be mounted:

  # def default_url

  version :medium do

  end

  version :thumb do

  # For images you might use something like this:
  def extension_white_list
    %w(jpg jpeg gif png)
